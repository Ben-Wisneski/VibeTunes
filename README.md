Inspiration
"The inspiration comes from a conversation with one of my friends about our music taste. He always thought that he could never find music that he liked and just was never "feeling" the music. The inspiration for VibeTunes came from this idea to help my friend.

What it does
It gives you a list of 10 songs that match your input. It takes your input of mood and genre and mash them together and then compares them to the Spotify api. By searching the playlists curated by the terms it insures that VibeTunes comes up with a high quality list.

How we built it
We built it using python and flask on the backend and then html and CSS on the frontend. We used python to connect to the Spotify api and make a list of songs then we used html and CSS to make the website in tandem with Python.

Challenges we ran into
I ran into a lot of challenges building the html and CSS code. I have not worked much with html so when working with it it was very difficult to work the frontend development of the project. Although it was time consuming and difficult, I still worked it out in the end.

Accomplishments that we're proud of
I am very proud of the frontend section of my code. The website is very sleek and very user friendly despite what was known about html and CSS.

What we learned
I learned a lot about html and CSS. Working with it for a hands on project like this forced me to learn much about it very fast. Despite what I knew about it before I learned so much for it in the code that was developed for it.

What's next for VibeTunes
The next thing for VibeTunes is to work it into a chrome extension and possibly beyond. Having it for a chrome extension would help so much with getting it out to the people and expose everyone to what VibeTunes is.
